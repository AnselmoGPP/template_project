Calculator for simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division...).
The menu offers operation choices, and then asks for 2 numbers.
Each entered number and calculated result must be stored in a struct recording: numeric value, parity, and entering order.
These records are stored in a matrix as `std::vector<NumberInfo>`.
Upon exiting the program, this matrix is printed to console as a well-formatted table.
Save matrix to file (.txt or .bin). Read from file and restore previous sessions.
Allow filtering data: Allow to view only even numbers, odd numbers, or specific results.
Associate each result with a descriptive string ("2 + 4 = 6").
